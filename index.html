    <p class="mt-3">The most laid back person with chronic anxiety you will ever meet. I love snowboarding, snow and
      mountains are
      where I feel more comfortable than anywhere else in the world. I also absolutely love Zelda games, so instead of
      talking more about myself I think I'd rather provide Zelda lore in a nutshell. Don't worry, it won't be nearly as
      verbose as you might think.</p>

    <p>The <em>Legend of Zelda</em> is very complex when it comes to timelines but the story itself is quite simple.
      Discovered in <em>'Skyward Sword'</em> princess Zelda is actually the reincarnation of the goddess "Hylia." The
      big bad guy in <em>Syward Sword</em>'s name is Demise. As the Link from the <em>'Skyward Sword'</em> game defeats
      Demise he is tossed into the abyss of death, but he proclaims that his evil spirit will live on and plague the
      land of Hyrule forever.</p>

    <p>This is where the reincarnation of Demise, known as Ganondorf, comes from and why he appears in <em>'Ocarina of
        Time'</em> and other games in the series as the biggest evil to threaten the land since Demise himself. There
      is speculation on whether every Link is a reincarnation of the hero chosen by Hylia (Zelda) or whether Link is
      simply a name passed down in the family's of the knights of Hyrule. The point that is agreed upon though, is that
      Link is supposed to represent a rather average person capable of great things such as saving the world.</p>
